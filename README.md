A collection of stringing guides

I created this repository to put together a collection of different lacrosse pockets contributed by anyone that wants to contribute and provide their own pocket.

The pockets are broken down into two broad categories:

[goalie](goalie.md)

[field](field.md)

From there you can browse based on the head, and then the pockets available for the head.

If you want to contribute a pocket to the collection, check out the [CONTRIBUTE.md](contribute.md) file for more instructions.
