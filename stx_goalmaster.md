# STX Shield 100 (formerly Goalmaster)

## Description

This is a goalie head that doesn't die. It's not the lightest. It's not the prettiest. But it gets the job done on a budget.
The stringing holes appear to be drilled, not molded into the design of the head. 

## Notes

* There appears to be a slight difference between the Shield 100 and Goalmaster.
The older Goalmaster heads have an extra sidewall hole near the top of the head.

* The holes across the top might be a little small to fit a top string through twice.
If you're careful, you can drill these out to accomodate normal top string stringing.
You can also add more holes down the sidewall, but be careful because these holes can also become weak points if done improperly.
