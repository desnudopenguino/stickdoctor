# CONTRIBUTE

If you are a stick doctor and would like to contribute your pocket to the collection, this file covers some of the standards and instructions to join in.

Please only post your own pockets, or other freely available pocket patterns with the proper credit.

To contribute, follow these steps:

1. Fork this repository

2. Create a MarkDown (.md) file with the name of the pocket, or some sort of descriptor and the brand and head as the file name. ex: `my-super-awesome-pocket_stx_x10.md`. Please follow the formatting in the template.md file.

2.1 You can also include images. Please make sure they are scaled down to a nice size (600px on the long end, compressed jpg format).

3. Add a link to your pocket in the proper location

3.1 If there is a page for the head you used, add it there

3.2 If there is not a page for the head you used, you can create a page for the head, and add a link to the page to your pocket.

4. Create a Pull Request (PR) for your pocket.

5. ??? (wait for your PR to be reviewed)

6. Profit? (or just enjoy having your pocket out there for others to see)
